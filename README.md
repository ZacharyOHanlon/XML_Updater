# XML_Updater
Script for finding and updating XML files

This script is designed to scan a directory for XML files, then parse the XML files. Then it outputs the results in a txt file with table formatting for viewing.

Roadmap: 
Rewrite script using select-XML instead of Select-string
fix issues with width formatting
move {replace} formatting into main formatting instead of after the fact.
